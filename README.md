# Processing Image Data for Deep Learning

A comprehensive tutorial notebook demonstrating fundamental image preprocessing techniques for deep learning applications using popular Python libraries.

## Project Overview

This Jupyter notebook covers essential image processing operations commonly used for preparing data before deep learning model training. It shows how to read, manipulate, and transform images using multiple Python libraries.

## Topics Covered

- Reading image files and converting them to NumPy arrays
- Resizing images to standard dimensions
- RGB to Grayscale conversion
- Displaying and saving processed images

## Libraries Used

- **Matplotlib**: Image loading and visualization
- **Pillow (PIL)**: Image resizing and manipulation
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Advanced image processing and color conversion
- **NumPy**: Array manipulation
- **Google Colab patches**: For displaying images in Colab

## Installation

pip install matplotlib pillow opencv-python numpy
